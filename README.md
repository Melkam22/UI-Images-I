# UI Images I

Upon cloning this repository, create an `index.html` file and a `css` folder with a `style.css` file in it.

Using the mockup below as a reference, create a page reflecting the information in the mockup.
This exercise has the sole objective of making sure that we understand how to use images in web design.

### Instructions

- Examine the mockup and replicate the web page using the relevant semantic HTML elements and with the following specifications.

1. Images for this exercise can be found in the `images` folder and should be compressed for maximum performance before being implemented.

1. Using the universal selector, reset the `box-sizing` to `border-box`.

1. Specifications for the first image are as follows:

   ```
   .banner
   - width: 100%
   ```

1. The next section should be in a container and has a class of `gallery` with the following specifications for each image:

   ```
   -  width: 33.33%
   -  margin: 20px
   ```

1. Use lists to achieve the gallery if you can and center the images horizontally within the container.

1. For the next section, create three instances of the avatar image having the class `avatar` on each with the following specifications:

   ```
   - width: 400px
   - height: 400px
   - margin: 40px
   ```

1. The avatars should be rounded as depicted in the mockup.

1. For the second avatar, create a class `avatar-mono`. Set the `opacity` to `0.5` and make the avatar black and white.

1. On hover, `avatar-mono` should show color again and have an `opacity` of `1` as in mockup II .

1. For the third avatar, create a class `avatar-blur` and blur the image by `4px`.
